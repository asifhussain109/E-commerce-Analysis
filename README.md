# E-commerce-Analysis
This analysis is based on a Company - UK based and registered non-store online retail. 
In this project I have firstly cleaned the dataset from missing values, removed duplicate rows and removed all the unwanted things from the dataset that is harmful for the analysis.
After that EDA was performed and then questions were answered to find the insights that make the bussiness grow. 
The dataset is large so I have made it into zip. Download the zip file and then extract it in your computer.
